# Exploring the Likelihood of the Spoiler Effect in Ranked Choice Voting Systems

## Project Summary
This project aims to quantify how common the Spoiler Effect is in Ranked Choice Voting systems. 

## Motivation
In [2019](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/11/05/ranked-choice-voting-adopted-in-new-york-city-along-with-other-ballot-measures-1226390), New York City (NYC) voted to start using a ranked choice system of 
voting. One of this project's team members lived in NYC at the time and could vote in this election. In the days 
leading up to the vote, she was hearing from both sides of the issue, and one argument stood out: that in a Ranked 
Choice Voting (RCV) system, a candidate whom *no one* felt strongly about could win. 

This phenomenon incorporates 
various theorems (including, most famously, [Arrow's Impossibility Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem)), but generally goes by the name 'The Spoiler Effect.' She and this project's 
other teammates wanted to know if this 'spoiler effect' was something voters should worry about, or if it 
was extraordinarily rare so as to not affect the outcome of most elections.

Of course, this project is still a work in progress (WIP) years after the 2019 election. This is because a secondary 
goal of this project is to simply increase our data science & software engineering skills. So, we took our time with each step in order 
to maximize learnings along the way (and, of course, we are doing this in our 'free' time). 

## Credits
Big thanks goes to all the researchers & authors who helped us understand the intricacies of different voting systems 
throughout this project. Particular gratitude goes to:
- [Jon Tingvold](https://github.com/jontingvold), the author of the [`pyrankvote`](https://github.com/jontingvold/pyrankvote) package without which this project would have been 
extremely difficult
- [Paul Butler](https://paulbutler.org), a self-proclaimed quant out of NYC whose website 
https://ranked.vote helped us model our synthetic data for this project
- [Aaron Hamlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronhamlin/), the Executive Director of [The Center for Election Science](https://electionscience.org) who 
put us in touch with Paul & generally helped us navigate the complicated world of voting systems.

## Methods
### Obstacles & how we dealt with them:
- Exhausted ballots: https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/ranked-choice-voting-is-not-the-solution/
- Noise
- Probabilities of vote spread across possible candidates

## How to run

## What to expect

## Available data for public use

## Thanks yous
